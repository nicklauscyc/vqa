# VQA
Visual question and answer

## Quick Start Notes
The instructions below detail how to activate the python 3 virtual environment
to ensure you have the correct dependencies
### On Linux and Mac
```
source activate-python-venv.sh
```


### On Windows
We recommend you use VSCode to run the scripts via the powershell.
At the bottom left of your opened VSCode screen there should be a blue bar, click on the environment. \

## Data Set
Data used for training can be found [here](https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/vqa/).
Be sure to download the `test`, `val`, `train` datasets and put them in this
directory. Don't worry the `.gitignore` has been set to not track these
folders since they contain data way past the Github limit
